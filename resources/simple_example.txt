This is some text.
    I'd like to see if my whitespace stays where I put it.    
The previous line had 4 spaces at the end of it.
	This line has a tab at the beginning.

Let's do substitutions. Anyone hungry for fruit?
The {$color} {$name} costs ${$price}.

Here are some other things which might match but shouldn't:
   {$obj->method()} Call method of obj and put the results here...??
   {$arr[0]} Output the first element of $arr.
   {$a["double"]} 
   {$a['single']}
   {No_dollar_sign}

So how are we doing? Is the {$name} still {$color}?
